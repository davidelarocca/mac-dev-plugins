description: Read-only assessment of what it takes to bring a macOS Swift/SwiftUI app to iOS - what can be shared as is, what needs an adapter, a UI adaptation or a redesign, what is unavailable - with file:line evidence, target structure options and a status per platform. Writes only docs/PORTING_PLAN.md. Use when the user asks about an iOS version, porting, or going multiplatform.

# Porting audit: macOS to iOS

Goal: a plan the user can decide on, built from evidence. Nothing is ported here: project, target and package changes come later, in verified steps.

## Ground rules

- Read only. The one file you write is `docs/PORTING_PLAN.md`, after the user has seen the summary. No other file, no project or package edit, no new target, no dependency change.
- Every claim cites `file:line`, or says what was not assessed and why. No evidence, no claim.
- Static evidence is not a build. Never say a module, a screen or the app is ready for iOS: say what was built, what was tested and what was reviewed, per platform, and nothing more.
- Decisions belong to the user. Compare options and recommend one; do not pick the target structure, cut a feature or change the product silently.
- Protected paths (CLAUDE.md, `.claude/swift-harness.json`) are assessed like the rest, and any change they would need is marked for explicit approval.

## 1. Start

1. Run `git status --porcelain` and keep the output: at the end, nothing but `docs/PORTING_PLAN.md` may differ.
2. Run `bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/porting.sh" summary` and `bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/porting.sh" scan` from the project root. The scan lists, per module, macOS-only API compiled for iOS (`blocks`), API that works differently on iOS (`adapt`) and macOS-only code already behind `#if` (`guarded`), with `file:line`. It reads text only and runs nothing.
3. Read what the project already knows, when present: `docs/architecture-contracts.json` (module graph), `docs/COMPONENT_REGISTRY.md` (shared UI), `docs/PRODUCT_MAP.md` (entities, destinations, actions), `docs/LAYOUT_CONTRACT.md` (screen sizes), `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, and the entitlements and `Info.plist` files of the app targets.

## 2. Investigate

Keep the main context clean: run Explore subagents in parallel, each returning findings with `file:line`, not file dumps:

1. **Modules and dependencies.** For each module of the scan: what it does, whether its `blocks` lines are incidental (one helper that needs an adapter) or the module's purpose (an AppKit wrapper). External dependencies: platforms they declare, those the scan could not check.
2. **Screens and interaction.** Per screen or feature: windows, split views, menus and commands, toolbars, hover, keyboard shortcuts, drag and drop, popovers, multiple windows, settings. What each becomes on iPhone and on iPad (size classes, Split View and Slide Over).
3. **System and files.** Sandbox and file access (security-scoped bookmarks, open and save panels, watched folders), background work, audio sessions, notifications, menu bar or login items, AppleScript or services, anything iOS does not offer or offers differently.
4. **Product.** Using the product map when present: which destinations and actions survive on a phone, which need a different entry point, which have no iOS counterpart and need a decision.

## 3. Classify

One row per module, then per feature or screen. Each gets exactly one class:

| Class | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Share as is | No macOS-only API compiled for iOS, no platform behavior. |
| Share with adapter | Mostly shared; a few macOS-only calls go behind a protocol or `#if os(...)`. Name them. |
| UI adaptation | Same feature, different interaction: touch, size classes, sheets instead of popovers or windows. |
| Redesign | The macOS design does not translate (multi-window workflows, menu bar apps, dense desktop tables): needs a product decision. |
| Unavailable | iOS has no equivalent (name the API). Needs a product decision to drop or replace it. |
| Not assessed | Say why (generated code, binary dependency, no access). |

## 4. Target structure

Compare at least: one multiplatform app target sharing everything, and separate macOS and iOS app targets sharing the packages. For each: what changes in the project, what is shared, effort, risks for the macOS app. Recommend one and say why, and say what would change the recommendation.

## 5. Build probe (only with the user's yes)

Ask: "Build each package for the iOS Simulator into a temporary DerivedData folder? This runs the project's build (manifests, build plugins, scripts), writes nothing in the project, and takes a few minutes." Only after a yes, per package with a scheme:

`xcodebuild build -scheme <scheme> -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' -derivedDataPath "$(mktemp -d)" -quiet` from the package folder.

Record the result with the date: builds, or fails with the first errors and their `file:line`. A failure the scan did not predict is a finding. Without a yes, the status says "not built".

## 6. Write the plan

Show the user a short summary first: the share of modules per class, the decisions needed, the recommended structure. Then write `docs/PORTING_PLAN.md` from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/port-to-ios/templates/PORTING_PLAN.md`. Run `git status --porcelain` again and compare with step 1: report any other file that changed, and do not hide it.

## After the plan

- The status per platform says "not started" for iOS until something was built and tested there. A build is not a test, and a test is not a UX review.
- Suggest the first steps in the order that keeps the macOS app working: shared packages first (adapters, `platforms:`), each verified on macOS and built for iOS, then the iOS target, then screens. Each step is its own branch; `scripts/verify.sh` with `PLATFORMS=("macOS" "iOS")` checks both.
- Porting itself is not done in this session.
