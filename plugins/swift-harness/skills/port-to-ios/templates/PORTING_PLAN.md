# Porting plan: macOS to iOS

Assessed on {{DATE}} at commit {{COMMIT}}, by `/swift-harness:port-to-ios`. Evidence is `file:line` at that commit. Static analysis is not a build: see the status below for what was actually built, tested and reviewed.

## Summary

{{FIVE_LINES: the share of modules per class, the decisions needed, the recommended structure, the biggest risk, the first step.}}

## Status per platform

| Platform | Built | Tests | UX review | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| macOS | {{yes, date / not run}} | {{passed, date / not run}} | {{done / not done}} | |
| iOS | {{not built / builds, date / fails, date}} | not run | not done | |

Never "ready": each column says what happened, on which date.

## Platforms and dependencies

{{Platforms declared (porting.sh summary). External dependencies and the platforms they declare, or "not checked".}}

## Modules

| Module | Class | Evidence | What it needs |
|---|---|---|---|

## Features and screens

| Feature or screen | Class | Evidence | iPhone | iPad |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Unavailable on iOS and redesigns

| What | Evidence | Options | Decision needed from |
|---|---|---|---|

## Target structure

| Option | What changes | Shared | Effort | Risks for macOS |
|---|---|---|---|---|

Recommendation: {{option, and why; what would change it}}.

## Steps
