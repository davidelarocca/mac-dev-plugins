# UI rules for feature code

- Before adding a view, style, modifier, overlay or popover, read `docs/COMPONENT_REGISTRY.md` and search the code for the same behavior. Reuse or extend; create only when behavior and responsibility differ.
- Import the design system and use its tokens: `Spacing`, `Radius`, `Typography`, `Motion`, semantic colors. No numeric padding, spacing, radius, font size, color or animation duration here.
- Showing an entity in a new place (row, tile, header, menu, inspector): check `docs/PRODUCT_MAP.md`. The new appearance opens the entity's destination, related entities shown with it (container, owner, category) open theirs, and it offers the entity's action set through the shared menu or command. Add the appearance to the map in the same change.
- Changing the layout of a screen listed in `docs/LAYOUT_CONTRACT.md`: it must still fit at its Min, Default, Max and around Compact below. Let content shrink, wrap or collapse (`ViewThatFits`, a menu) instead of fixed widths and `.fixedSize()` rows. Keep the window's `.frame(minWidth:minHeight:)` on the window's view, not on the content the test measures. Popovers, sheets and secondary windows open inside the window at Min. A new main screen gets a row and a `LayoutContract.check` test.
- Collections the user creates or organizes get create, rename, reorder, delete and undo, or a row in the map's "Exceptions" saying why not.
- Transient feedback (pills, toasts, banners) goes through the shared presenter in the environment. Never build a local overlay for it.
- Buttons use the shared `ButtonStyle`s. Hover, pressed, selected and disabled states come from the design system.
- Follow each platform the view runs on. iOS: text styles so Dynamic Type scales the text, touch targets of at least 44 pt, content inside the safe area, layouts that follow size class (compact width on iPhone and in iPad multitasking). macOS: hover, focus and keyboard access.
- Every action works without a pointer: Return and Escape for the default and cancel actions, arrows in lists, a Command shortcut where the platform expects one, Tab through the controls in visual order. A shared component with keyboard actions gets a `KeyboardCheck` test; a main screen gets a `FocusOrder` test when the project has a UI test target.
- Content that moves (a slide or move transition, an animated position, size or scale) reads `@ReduceMotion` and goes through `Motion.moving(_:reduced:)`, so Reduce Motion gets a fade or no animation.
- Keep `body` small. Extract subviews when a body grows past roughly 40 lines or mixes several responsibilities.
- Views read state and send intents. Business rules, file I/O and playback control live in models or services.
- If you need something the design system lacks, add it to the design system first (follow the `ui-change` skill), then use it here.
