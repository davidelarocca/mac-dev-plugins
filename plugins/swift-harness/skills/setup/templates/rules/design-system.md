# Rules for the design system itself

- This is the only place where raw visual values are allowed. Every value gets a token name that describes intent, not appearance (`Spacing.section`, not `Spacing.twelve`).
- Public API stays minimal: callers pass content and intent, never layout numbers.
- Every public component has previews for each state: default, hover where relevant, pressed, selected, disabled, light and dark appearance, long text.
- Every public component has snapshot tests. Re-record snapshots only on purpose, and say so in the commit message.
- Separate presentation from behavior: a view draws, a presenter or style decides when and how it appears.
- Changing a component's behavior or API means updating its entry in `docs/COMPONENT_REGISTRY.md` in the same change, and checking every caller listed there.
- No dependencies from the design system on app features, models or services.
