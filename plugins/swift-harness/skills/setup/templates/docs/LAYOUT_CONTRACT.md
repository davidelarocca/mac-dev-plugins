# Layout contract

How each main screen holds up as its window or pane is resized. Read it before changing the layout of a
screen listed here, and update it in the same change.

Sizes are in points, `<width>x<height>`, or `<width>` alone when the height does not matter.

- The end-of-turn check (swift-harness) keeps the table true: each View exists in its File, and tests
  measure the View and the Window.
- The tests do the measuring, with `LayoutContract.check("<View or Window>") { ... }`:
  - **View**, the screen's content, is proposed each size of its row: Min, just below and at Compact below,
    Default, Max. It fails when it needs more room than that: content clipped or pushed out of the window.
  - **Window**, the view the window shows (the content with the window's `.frame(minWidth:minHeight:)`), must
    declare Min as its minimum: not less, or the window shrinks to sizes the screen was not designed for; not
    more, or it never reaches Min. With a Max, it must not grow past it.
  - Measure the content without the window's frame: a minimum or fixed frame around a view hides content
    wider than the frame.
- Not measured: truncated text, overlapping content, and where popovers and secondary windows open. Those are
  checked in review, against the rows below. `Screenshot.capture("<View>") { ... }` in the same tests saves
  images of the screen at Min and Default for that review.

## Screens

| Screen | View | File | Window | Min | Default | Max | Compact below | Compact behavior |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | | | | | |

- **View**: the SwiftUI type of the screen's content. **File**: where it is declared, from the repository root.
  A split view (`NavigationSplitView`, `HSplitView`) takes any width, so its content cannot be measured: name
  its window type as View and Window, and give each page of the detail column and the sidebar a row of its own,
  with Min the width its column gets at the window's Min.
- **Window**: for a screen that fills a window, the type the window shows, which declares the window's
  minimum size (often `View().frame(minWidth: ..., minHeight: ...)` in its own type). Empty for a pane (a
  sidebar, an inspector, a detail column), which is measured as View only. It can be the View itself when the
  content declares its own minimum and has nothing that could overflow around it.
- **Max**: a size, or `-` for none. **Compact below**: a width under which the screen switches to a compact
  layout, or `-`. **Compact behavior**: what changes below it (which controls collapse into a menu, what
  hides, what becomes a popover).

## Presented UI

Popovers, sheets, menus, tooltips and secondary windows opened from these screens. At the screen's Min size
they must open inside the window, or on screen for a separate window.

| Element | Opened from | Kind | Size | At the minimum size |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | |

## Exceptions

Deliberate departures from the rules above, with the reason.
